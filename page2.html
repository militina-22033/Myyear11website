        <p>To understand the significance of the ta'ovala we must first understand the core values of Tongan society. These values are Fefaka'apa'apa'aki(respect), Feveitokai'aki(colaboration, sharing and fufilling ones obligations), Lototoo(humility and genorosity) and Tauhi vaha'a(dedication and dependability). </p>
        <p>To make is possible for web sites to work across a range of devices, web pages use
        two separate tools, also called languages. The first tells your device what to display
        on screen and the second tells your device how to display it.</p>
        <h1>HTML and CSS</h1>
        <p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and Cascading Style Sheets 
        (CSS) are two common tools used two create and present digital media. 
        In the same way that English, MƒÅori and Sign language are the official languages of 
        New Zealand that are used to create traditional media, 
        HTML and CSS are two of the official languages of the Internet used to create web 
        pages and many Apps.</p>
        <p>As with any language, digital or not, they change over time and have "official"
        versions. The current official HTML version is 5 and CSS is 3.</p>

        <p>HTML describes the structure and meaning of your media. It says, "this part is a 
        heading" or "this part is a paragraph" or "this part is a navigation block". 
        CSS is used for the presentation. It tells your device how to display the media and
        can tell different devices to display the same media differently.</p>
        <p>For example, take a look at the <a href = "https://learncoach.com" target = "_blank">LearnCoach</a> web site as it appears on a mobile 
        devices and on a desktop web browser. The information is the same, but using CSS, 
        the presentation is different.</p>
