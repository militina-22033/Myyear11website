                <h1>Tongan Ta'ovala</h1> <!--This is a main heading-->
                <p>A lot of you might be wondering what a ta'ovala is?</p>
            A ta'ovala is a sacred and cherished part of the Tongan culture.It's a mat wrapped 
           around the waist and tied with a kafa. You can instantly tell apart a tongan from 
           anyone else just from their ta'ovala. It seperates us from Samoa, Fiji, and the other 
           Pacific Islands. However the history and it's importance to Tongans is widely 
          unknown.</p>
                <p>I want to open a door and let everyone into Tongan culture and explain a bit 
                  about the ta'ovala and it's history</p>
                <h1>A Old Legend</h1>
                <p>A group of Tongan man set voyage to visit the Tu'i Tonga(king). The Tongan men just experienced a tough boat ride and felt their clothes wern't presentable for the king. They cut the laufala mat from their sails and wrapped it around their waist. The Tu'i was so pleased with the humility of these men that he ordered his entire court to dress the same way. Supposedly this was the origin of the ta'ovala.</p>
